When I give my assistant a name and as it is only accessible to me, it is then "personal" to me. 
There is not much obviously outstanding challenges when using "this" for me, as Javascript is easy to understand at least in this part.
I might improve "completeTask()" to track task history, and add a mood-changing feature in it.
